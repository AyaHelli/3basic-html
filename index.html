    <h1>only love </h1>
    <div>
        <p>I tell myself you don't mean<span> <h2> a thing And what we got,</h2></span> got no hold on me But when you're not there, I just crumble I tell myself I don't care that much But I feel like I die 'til I feel your touch <br> Only love Only love
            can hurt like this Only love can hurt like this <br>Must have been a deadly kiss Only love can hurt like this Say I wouldn't care if you walked away But every time you're there, I'm begging you to stay When you come close, I just tremble And
            every time, every time you go It's like a knife that <br>cuts right through my soul Only love Only love can hurt like this Only love can hurt like this Must have been a deadly kiss Only love can hurt like this Only love can hurt like this
            Your kisses burn into my skin Only love can hurt like this But if<br> the sweetest pain Burning hot through my veins Love is torture Makes me more sure Only love can hurt like this Only love can hurt like this Only love can hurt like this
            Must have been a <br>deadly kiss Only love can hurt like this Only love can hurt like this Your kisses burn into my skin Only love can hurt<br> like this (Only love can hurt like this) Only love can hurt like this (Only love can hurt) Save
            me Save me Only love, only love 'Cause only love can hurt this And it must have been a deadly kiss</p>
